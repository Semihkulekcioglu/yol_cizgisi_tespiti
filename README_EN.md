## About the Project
This project is a lane detection system developed to enhance driving safety. Using OpenCV and NumPy libraries, lane lines are detected in real-time from video streams.

## How It Works
The system processes video frames through several stages:
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Grayscale conversion and noise reduction
2. **Edge Detection**: Canny edge detection algorithm
3. **Region of Interest**: Focusing on the road area
4. **Line Detection**: Hough transform for line detection
5. **Lane Tracking**: Filtering and smoothing detected lines
